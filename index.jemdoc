== About me
I am a Member of Technical Staff at [https://inflection.ai/ Inflection AI Inc.], where I work on large scale model training, inference and infrastructure. Before this, I was a staff machine learning and computer vision engineer at Apple, where my role was to bridge the gap between learning algorithms (classification, detection and others), features specs (hand gestures, Persona, Optic ID, others), hardware capacities ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Engine ANE], camera, ISP, SOC), and software implementation for [https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/ Apple Vision Pro] Product. Prior to this position, I was at the Face ID team, where I led the development of the first-generation face recognition for Face ID unlock with mask and the second-generation face recognition for Face ID in iPhone 13 and later version at Apple. I obtained my PhD from [http://uiowa.edu The University of Iowa] in 2018, supervised by [https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~tyng/ Prof. Tianbao Yang]. My research focuses on optimizing deep neural networks from speeding up training, improving generalization ability, reducing model size and searching optimal network structure, and its application to computer vision and language tasks. I received my bachelor's degree and master's degree both in computer science from [http://xjtu.edu.cn Xian Jiaotong University] and [http://sdstate.edu South Dakota State University] in 2010 and 2013, respectively. In case that you need to reach out me, my email is zhelixjtu/ \[@\] gmail \[DOT\] com.
== News
- I will give a [talks/searchOptimalStructure.pdf guest lecture] on automatically searching the optimal neural network structures in deep learning course at The University of Iowa.
- We gave a [talks/aistats2018-exp-concave-ppt.pdf presentation] on our oral AISTATS 2018 [pubs/aistats2018-exp-concave.pdf paper]. 
- I gave a [talks/Compress.pdf guest lecture] on compressing deep neural networks in deep learning course at The University of Iowa.
== Research Interest
#~~~
My research interests fall into three levels:
- understanding why machine can learn from learning theory perspective (statistical machine learning);
- designing and analyzing optimization algorithms to facilitate machine learning efficiently;
- utilizing machine learning models(Specifically, deep neural networks) to solve vision, language and other tasks.

\n This lecture tried to teach students widely from The university of Iowa how to install caffe in the university cluster [https://wiki.uiowa.edu/display/hpcdocs/Argon+Cluster argon] and how to train the very first deep neural network model for image classification using caffe. The installation in Argon clusteris quite tricky since students don't have root access to cluster.  See [notes/Installation_Caffe_on_Argon_Cluster.pdf Notes] for detail information if you want to install caffe in your cluster environment.
